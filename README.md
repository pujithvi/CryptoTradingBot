# CryptoTradingBot

This is a basic trading bot that was built using python. The first thing this bot does is it connects to an exchange and fetches the live data.
Then, a trading algorithm is applied on the fetched data to generate the BUY/SELL signal. Lastly, the trade is actually executed; the BUY/SELL 
order is placed based on the signal.

At the bottom of the code, the bot is ran as a demo on bitcoin traded against USDT.
